Within this project, we will try to limit down all the well information and data and try to isolate the data into a few key features that can still accurately predict oil and gas production.

This project is split into 3 parts, each of which have their own separate file. The folders are (should be opened in this order):

1) Wellbore Data Manipulation

This folder will deal with all the wellbore manipulation that we did. In it, we try to find all the unique wells that we will be working with and what information each well has. This was done because we noticed from a brief glance at the data, there are many wells that appear in several of the different data files and we wanted to make sure that we selected a pool of wells that contained useful information

2) Field Data Manipulation

This folder will deal with all the field data manipulation that we did. In it, we try to consolidate all the field data into one file to make it easier to work with. Some of the data was easy to extract and consolidate but some other data took more effort to extract and consolidate We also had to extract new data out of the data we were given such as finding out the duration of a fields experiemental and developmental phases.

3) Correlation and Regression Manipulation

This folder will deal with all the correlation and regression manipulation that we did. In it, we take all the information and files made in the previous 2 folders and uses them to find out how correlated features are to one another and to production. From there we find out how well those selected features can predict oil and gas production.
